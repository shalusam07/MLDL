# DLML
MLDL stands for Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It refers to a field within artificial intelligence where algorithms and models are designed to enable machines to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Machine learning involves the development of techniques that allow computers to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks over time. It encompasses various types of algorithms like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Deep learning, on the other hand, is a subset of machine learning that focuses on artificial neural networks and algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning models, such as neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"), excel at tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.

The combination of machine learning and deep learning has led to significant advancements in various domains, including healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and many others, by enabling systems to learn from data patterns and make informed decisions or predictions.
